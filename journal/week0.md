# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

<p> For the first week in the AWS free code camp I worked on verifying my aws account and setting up billing alarms as well as a budget. I set my budget for to $20 per month for this project and set a billing alaram to alert me once I approach $10.<p>
  
## Required Homework  
I used Lucid charts to build out my conceptual and logical diagrams. Below are the links to both of them in Lucid charts:

Creating these diagrams proved to be challenging for me as I have never used Lucid charts before, but with instructional videos provided by Andrew Brown, I was able to successfully complete the diagrams.
